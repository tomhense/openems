/**
 * HttpBridge to handle request to a endpoint.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a request is scheduled every cycle and the request does take longer than
 * one cycle it is not executed multiple times instead it waits until the last
 * request is finished and will be executed with the next cycle.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To get a reference to a bridge object include this in your component:
 * 
 * <pre>
   <code>@Reference</code>(scope = ReferenceScope.PROTOTYPE_REQUIRED)
   private BridgeHttp httpBridge;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A simple example to subscribe to an endpoint every cycle would be:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * this.httpBridge.subscribeEveryCycle("http://127.0.0.1/status", t -> {
 * 	// process data
 * }, t -> {
 * 	// handle error
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an enpoint does not require to be called every cycle it can also be
 * configured with e. g. {@link BridgeHttp#subscribe(int, String, Consumer)}
 * where the first value could be 5 then the request gets triggered every 5th
 * cycle.
